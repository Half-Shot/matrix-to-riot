Matrix.to Riot
==============

This is a tiny webextension to forward matrix.to links to an open Riot tab.

This only works if you are using the browser edition of Riot, and only 
if you are using riot.im/app or riot.im/develop. In the future, this will
be configurable.

### Installing

There is a zip file that filefox will install from under releases. You
can open the file in Firefox by going to:

Addons > Cog > Install Addons from File... > Open the zip file.

You need to disable ``xpinstall.signatures.required`` in ``about:config`` 
for Firefox before installing because Firefox only allow addons signed
by Mozilla, and I've not gotten around to getting it verified. You can 
open the zip yourself if you don't trust that I've packaged it correctly.
